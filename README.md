- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KeaganChasenski

Safari Guide, Engineer and thinker.

- About me:
  
I'm an engineer and founder passionate about the outdoors and building technology that simplifies and elevates real-world experiences.

After growing up in Johannesburg, I spent my school years exploring reserves in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands â€” experiences that eventually led me to pursue my dream of becoming a professional safari guide. Following my engineering studies at the University of Cape Town, I now work as a ranger/guide at Londolozi, where I combine my love of nature with leadership, storytelling, and operations in remote environments.

To me, engineering and people are inextricably linked. I'm especially interested in the intersection of software, sustainability, and emerging technologies, where nuanced challenges require both systems thinking and empathy. In my free time, I tinker with that, cameras and the occasional golf club. I also write sometimes.
